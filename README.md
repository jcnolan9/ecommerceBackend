# employeeTracker

## Description
In this project, I use an ORM called Sequalize to connect to my MySQL database and build models for an ecommerce-like backend. Additionally, I build api routes for a user to be able to 
create, view, update, and delete items in each of the database tables. The API uses Get requests for viewing the data, POST requests for creating new rows in the database,
PUT requests for updating existing rows, and DELETE requests for deleting existing rows.
